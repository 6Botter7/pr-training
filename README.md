# pr-training

This project is aimed at someone who is interested in learning web development from the fundamental concepts, 
to more advanced topics, as well as Pragma specific technologies. It looks to strike a balance between theory and practical,
where each section includes theory material to work through, as well as a practical section where your knowledge within
that area is evaluated. 

## Before Getting Started

If you are already comfortable using a version control system and have a code editor of your choice ready to go, you can skip ahead.

Before jumping into learning and practicing please work through the following checklist:

- Ensure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- Please fork the [pr-training repository](https://github.com/caperaven/pr-training) to your account
- Once the repository has been forked to your account, clone it to your local machine. It may be easier to download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), and work through the following guide if you are lost: [Cloning and forking repositories from GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop#managing-fork-behavior)
- Ensure you have a code editor to load the project into and begin making changes. A common free editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- You're all set ðŸ˜Š

## Topics

### HTML & CSS Fundamentals

This section takes you through the core concepts surrounding two of the web's underlying technologies: HTML and CSS. 
This is your starting point if you have little to no experience with Web Development. The sections which follow build upon 
the concepts laid out in this section, so it may be good to review or brush up on your knowledge even if you're fairly confident in HTML & CSS.
