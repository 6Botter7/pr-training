        Use svg symbols.
        ----------------
        This is an easy way to create icons for your application and use them multiple times.

        Documentation:
        --------------
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/symbol

        Download svg at:
        ----------------
        https://materialdesignicons.com/
        1. right click on image you want to use
        2. in context menu select "view svg"
        3. copy the path/s and use it in your symbol

        When copying over the path, you can remove the fill attribute as this will interfere with styling.
        Typically, the result you are looking for should look something like this.
        <path d="M3,6H21V8H3V6M3,11H21V13H3V11M3,16H21V18H3V16Z"/>

        Creating a symbol
        -----------------
        symbol elements must be in a svg element.
        since the svg width is generally 24px by 24px, set the svg width and height accordingly.
        remember to set the viewBox to "0 0 24 24". because we have this on the svg we don't need to add it to each symbol.
        if however you use a svg that does not fit this viewBox you will need that to the symbol according to the width and height of the icon.

        create a symbol element in the svg element and give it an id attribute.
        this is important as you will refer to the icon by that name when using it.

        Using a symbol
        --------------
        You can use a symbol with the "use" element.
        The use element must be in a svg element where the width and height is set to 24 and 24 matching the viewBox size.
        The use element must have a href attribute referencing the icon name as defined by the symbol id.
        Note the # before the id, this is a standard css selector for an element by id.

        Creating a toolbar
        ------------------
        As a rule buttons should be on a toolbar.
        There are exceptions but for now lets just say that buttons need to be on a toolbar.
        To create a toolbar you use a div element and set the role attribute to "toolbar".
        This is required from a web accessibility perspective but also helps with testing.

        A couple of notes about the button
        ----------------------------------
        1. A button should always have an id attribute. This is required for attaching events but also testing.
        2. The button has a style "icon-button", without this style the location of the icon will be off.
